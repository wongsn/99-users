# Backend Tech Challenge
An exercise to assess your skills with Python, [Tornado](http://tornadoweb.org/) (Web Framework), writing non-blocking/asynchronous code, and microservices architecture.

## Introduction
We're building a system that stores information about users and properties that are available to rent or buy. The system is designed as a set of small web applications that each perform a specific task (otherwise known as "microservices").

Please read [the Wikipedia article about microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) if you are not familar with the architecture before.

Some parts of the system have been built already. We need to your help to complete the rest!

### Architecture
This system comprises of 3 independent web applications:

- **Listing service:** Stores all the information about properties that are available to rent and buy
- **User service:** Stores information about all the users in the system
- **Public API layer:** Set of APIs that are exposed to the web/public

The listing service and user service are backed by relevant databases to persist data. The services are essentially a wrapper around their respective databases to manipulate the data stored in them. For this reason, the services are not intended to be directly accessible by any external client/application.

Services are free to store the data in any format they wish (in a SQL table, or as a document in a NoSQL db, etc.). The only requirement is for them to expose a set of REST APIs that return data in a standardised JSON format. Services are the guardians/gatekeepers for their respective databases. **Any other application/service that wishes to access the data must go solely through the REST APIs exposed by the service. It cannot access the data directly from the database at any cost.**

How does the mobile app or user-facing website access the data in the system? This is where the public API layer comes in. The public API layer is a web application that contains APIs that can be called by external clients/applications. This web application is responsible for interacting with the listing/user service through its APIs to pull out the relevant data and return it to the external caller in the appropriate format.

### 1) Listing Service
The listing service stores information about properties that are available to rent or buy. These are the fields available in a listing object:

- `id (int)`: Listing ID _(auto-generated)_
- `user_id (int)`: ID of the user who created the listing _(required)_
- `price (int)`: Price of the listing. Should be above zero _(required)_
- `listing_type (str)`: Type of the listing. `rent` or `sale` _(required)_
- `created_at (int)`: Created at timestamp. In microseconds _(auto-generated)_
- `updated_at (int)`: Updated at timestamp. In microseconds _(auto-generated)_

#### APIs
##### Get all listings
Returns all the listings available in the db (sorted in descending order of creation date). Callers can use `page_num` and `page_size` to paginate through all the listings available. Optionally, you can specify a `user_id` to only retrieve listings created by that user.

```
URL: GET /listings

Parameters:
page_num = int # Default = 1
page_size = int # Default = 10
user_id = str # Optional. Will only return listings by this user if specified
```
```json
Response:
{
    "result": true,
    "listings": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "user_id": 1,
            "listing_type": "rent",
            "price": 6000,
            "created_at": 1475820997000000,
            "updated_at": 1475820997000000,
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Create listing
```
URL: POST /listings
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Parameters: (All parameters are required)
user_id = int
listing_type = str
price = int
```
```json
Response:
{
    "result": true,
    "listing": {
        "id": 1,
        "user_id": 1,
        "listing_type": "rent",
        "price": 6000,
        "created_at": 1475820997000000,
        "updated_at": 1475820997000000,
    }
}
```

### 2) User Service
The user service stores information about all the users on the system. Fields available in the user object:

- `id (int)`: User ID _(auto-generated)_
- `name (str)`: Full name of the user _(required)_
- `created_at (int)`: Created at timestamp. In microseconds _(auto-generated)_
- `updated_at (int)`: Updated at timestamp. In microseconds _(auto-generated)_

#### APIs

## Requirements
The listing service has been built already. You need to build the remaining two components: the user service and the public API layer. The implementation of the listing service can serve as a good starting point to learn more about how to structure a web application using the Tornado web framework.

The first priority would be to get a working system up and running! A great submission would demonstrate a grasp of the principles of microservice architecture.

You are required to use tornado's built in framework for HTTP request.

## Setup
We will be using Python 3 for this exercise.

### Install pip
pip is a handy tool to install libraries/dependencies for your python programs. pip should already come installed on your system. Head over to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ for steps to install pip if it's not available.

### Install virtualenv
We use virtualenv to create an isolated running environment to install dependencies and launch the web application. Head over to https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html for instructions to install virtualenv.

### Install dependencies
Once you have pip and virtualenv set up, we can proceed to create the environment to run our web applications:

```bash
# Locate the path for the Python 3 installation
which python3

# Create the virtual environment in a folder named "env" in the current directory
virtualenv env --python=<path_to_python_3>

# Start the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# Install the required dependencies/libraries
pip install -r python-libs.txt
```
You'll see `(env)` show up at the beginning of the command line if you've started virtual environment successfully. To check if the dependencies are installed correctly, run `pip freeze` and check if the output looks something like this:

```
tornado==6.1
```

### Run the listing service
Now we're all set to run the listing service!

```bash
# Run the listing service
python listing_service.py --port=6000 --debug=true
```
The following settings that can be configured via command-line arguments when starting the app:

- `port`: The port number to run the application on (default: `6000`)
- `debug`: Runs the application in debug mode. Applications running in debug mode will automatically reload in response to file changes. (default: `true`)

### Create listings
Time to add some data into the listing service!

```bash
curl localhost:8888/listings -XPOST \
    -d user_id=1 \
    -d listing_type=rent \
    -d price=4500
```
